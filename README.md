# Sudoku game in UWP / C#

This is one version of my Sudoku game from years back, based on my WinForms version of the game (also available in Github). The code is a delightful mess from along the years, with several styles and ideas I've picked up along the way - I can't be arsed to clean it up, so it is what it is.

The game is made in UWP with C# code. There are a bunch of predefined Sudoku layouts in the game, and it can randomize a layout based on those by rotating and changing numbers, to make there appear to be a bit more variation than there actually is. The solving engine uses a logic approach to check if the game can be solved, and for solving the whole game board. It's not super advanced so it might not be able to solve everything that is solvable, but... meh.
