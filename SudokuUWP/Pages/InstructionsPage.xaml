                <TextBlock FontSize="18" Margin="0,0,0,10" TextWrapping="Wrap">In the game of Sudoku, the objective is to solve all cells of a 9x9 grid. The game 
                    starts with some of the cells given, i.e. there are already numbers in them. These given cells are then used as clues to determine what numbers 
                    go into the other cells.</TextBlock>

                <TextBlock FontSize="18" Margin="0,0,0,10" TextWrapping="Wrap">The rules for which numbers can go into which cells are simple: any vertical row 
                    or horizontal line of 9 cells may only contain each number from 1 to 9, exactly once. The main grid is also composed of 9 smaller, 3x3 grids. 
                    Each of these smaller grids may only have each digit exactly once.</TextBlock>

                <TextBlock FontSize="18" Margin="0,0,0,10" TextWrapping="Wrap">The game is solved - or won - when all cells are correctly filled with numbers 
                    withtout conflicting the rules.</TextBlock>

                <TextBlock FontSize="18" Margin="0,0,0,20" TextWrapping="Wrap">Many variations of the game exist, with varying size of the grid and some kind of variant
                    of the rules. This version of the game is played by the basic rules.</TextBlock>

                <TextBlock FontSize="18" Margin="0,0,0,10" TextWrapping="Wrap"><Run FontWeight="Bold">To start a game,</Run> hit the "Start new game" button on the
                    main window. This will randomize the given cells from a list of existing, predefined layouts, shuffled in many ways to create more layouts to
                    solve.</TextBlock>

                <TextBlock FontSize="18" Margin="0,0,0,10" TextWrapping="Wrap">Select the cell in which you wish to place a number, either by tapping or clicking
                    with the mouse. The selected cell is shown in light blue background color. You may only place numbers in empty cells, or cells that you have 
                    set before - the initial given numbers are displayed in gray color and may not be overwritten.</TextBlock>

                <TextBlock FontSize="18" Margin="0,0,0,10" TextWrapping="Wrap">If you make a choice that leads the game to an un-solvable state, the borders will
                    turn red to indicate this. Note, that the solving engine is not 100% accurate; sometimes, a game may be solvable even if the game engine 
                    thinks it is not. Mostly, though, you will probably have made a mistake, in which case the cells in question are shown in red color.</TextBlock>

                <TextBlock FontSize="18" Margin="0,0,0,20" TextWrapping="Wrap">After setting a number, you can set that same number to other cells by double-clicking
                    on the cell in which you wish to place the same number. Cells that already have that particular number will be shown in blue color.</TextBlock>

                <TextBlock FontSize="18" Margin="0,0,0,10" TextWrapping="Wrap"><Run FontWeight="Bold">If you get stuck</Run> at any point during a game, you can
                    press the "Hint" button to get one cell solved for you. This cell is shown in green font color. You can also have the game engine attempt to
                    solve the whole game by pressing the "Solve game" button.</TextBlock>

                <TextBlock FontSize="18" Margin="0,0,0,10" TextWrapping="Wrap">After solving a game, great wisdoms will be revealed to you. Or, at least something
                    mildly amusing...</TextBlock>
